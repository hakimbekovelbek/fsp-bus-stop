            <p>
                On a Wednesday evening in February 1972, as police officers and
                emergency responders in New Paltz, N.Y., flocked to a fire, somebody
                snatched a pair of 19th-century portraits of a wealthy local couple
                from a historical society elsewhere in town.
            </p>
            <p>
                The theft also resulted in the loss of dozens of objects, some three
                centuries old, including a prayer book, a powder horn and antique guns
                and swords. At the time, the president of the society estimated the
                items to be worth about $30,000, a figure he said was dwarfed by the
                sentimental value they offered the historic community, which is about
                85 miles north of New York City and was settled in the 17th century by
                the descendants of French Protestants.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many of the items were recovered at a Manhattan thrift shop several
                weeks later, but the paintings from the 1820s — sullen portraits of a
                rosy-cheeked man with a puckered mouth and a woman holding a snuff box
                — were not among them.
            </p>
            <p>
                This month — more than 50 years after the theft — the
                <cite><a target="_blank"
                        href="https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/newyork/news/press-releases/fbi-art-crime-team-returns-paintings-stolen-five-decades-ago">
                        F.B.I. announced</a></cite>
                that the portraits had been returned to the society, Historic Huguenot
                Street, thanks in part to the persistent detective work of two local
                sleuths — a curator and a librarian.
            </p>
            <p>
                Immediately after the crime took place, it was infused with intrigue.
                Local officials speculated that the fire, at a Veterans of Foreign
                Wars building, was linked to the theft, a theory that gained traction
                in a local newspaper. While the police responded to the fire,
                <q>the robbers had a free hand on Huguenot Street,</q> The Daily
                Freeman of Kingston, N.Y., reported.
            </p>
            <p>
                The paintings were done in oil by Ammi Phillips, a famed 19th-century
                portraitist, and they depicted Dirck D. Wynkoop and his wife, Annatje
                Eltinge, key figures in the history of New Paltz. Mr. Wynkoop owned
                farmland that had helped feed the American colonists during the
                Revolutionary War. He had a darker history that was also entwined with
                that of the fledgling country: He owned slaves.
            </p>
            <p>
                To Carol Johnson, a librarian at Elting Memorial Library in New Paltz
                and a society trustee, the theft of the paintings deprived local
                residents of a chance to learn how their history connected to the
                broader story of America, warts and all.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the coronavirus pandemic took hold in 2020, Ms. Johnson joined up
                with Josephine Bloodgood, the curator of the historical society, to
                create an exhibit about a man named Jacob Wynkoop, a New Paltz
                carpenter who was among the first Black men in the community to vote
                and who fought in the Civil War. Jacob Wynkoop’s father had been
                enslaved by Dirck D. Wynkoop.
            </p>
            <p>
                Their mutual interest in Jacob Wynkoop led Ms. Johnson and Ms.
                Bloodgood to take a crack at solving the mystery of the missing
                paintings.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ms. Johnson and Ms. Bloodgood were armed with a black-and-white
                postcard image of the stolen portraits that had been distributed to
                art dealers shortly after the theft. They compared notes and records
                but quickly hit a roadblock: The paintings, to their knowledge, simply
                had not surfaced in the half-century since they were taken.
            </p>
            <p>
                A break came around June 2020, when they spotted the paintings in an
                online catalog of works by Mr. Phillips. The catalog said that the
                portraits were of unidentified subjects and that they were sold at
                auction by Sotheby’s in 2005.
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>There was shock that they were out there in plain sight</q> Ms.
                Bloodgood said.
            </p>
            <p>
                After purchasing a Sotheby’s catalog from eBay, Ms. Bloodgood
                confirmed that the paintings had, in fact, been put up for auction in
                2005, and that they had sold for roughly $13,000, a paltry amount
                compared with some of Mr. Phillips’s more famous work.
            </p>
            <p>
                With their research in hand, the two women contacted the F.B.I., which
                has a team dedicated to art crime. It subpoenaed Sotheby’s and
                discovered the name of the buyer, who was unaware that the paintings
                had been stolen, according to the F.B.I. and the researchers. The
                buyer agreed to turn over the paintings, the researchers said, though
                it was unclear whether the buyer received money in return.
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>It’s so rare to have portraits of individuals from this early
                    period, especially for New Paltz </q>> Ms. Bloodgood said.
                <q>We’re so pleased to have the Wynkoop portraits back in the
                    collection, where they can again be interpreted to tell a fuller
                    story of our community and how it relates to the rich and
                    complicated history of our country.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                The researchers never contacted Sotheby’s for help. The couple’s names
                were on the backs of the paintings. Ms. Johnson said that should have
                been enough information for the auction house to know the paintings
                were stolen.
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>We could not understand why Sotheby’s did not do their due
                    diligence and look up these paintings,</q>
                Ms. Johnson said. Sotheby’s did not respond to messages seeking
                comment.
            </p>
            <p>
                A lack of transparency among auction houses and a desire to protect
                the privacy of art buyers and sellers create a culture in which art
                theft can flourish, said Erin Thompson, an associate professor of art
                crime at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dr. Thompson says auction houses like Sotheby’s and Christie’s argue
                that art is often sold under sensitive circumstances — the “three D’s”
                of death, divorce and debt. According to Dr. Thompson, these are the
                circumstances that the auction houses contend beg for privacy.
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>From the perspective of me — suspicious, cynical art critic — it
                    creates opportunity to launder stolen or looted objects, as seems to
                    have happened with these,</q>
                she said, adding that it was unclear what paperwork Sotheby’s received
                with the paintings.
                <q>Who knows how convincing that paperwork is or what the auction
                    house asked for?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                The F.B.I. could not be reached. Ms. Johnson and Ms. Bloodgood said
                that an agent told them that the statute of limitations had passed.
                Even though the paintings are back in the historical society’s hands,
                which was Ms. Johnson and Ms. Bloodgood’s main goal, the women have
                still not solved the mystery of who took them in the first place.
            </p>
            <p>
                They plan to keep exploring that question as they try to locate other
                items lost in the theft.
