Trump’s attempts to remain in power after the 2020 election.</p>

<p class="p2">Here’s how to better understand the proceedings:</p>

<h3 class="tabel">Who voted for the Jan. 6 House committee?</h3>

<p class="p2">On June 30, 2021, the House voted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/30/us/house-jan-6-capitol-riot.html">mostly along party lines</a> to create the select committee, which was established at the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/24/us/pelosi-capitol-riot.html">behest of Speaker Nancy Pelosi </a> after Senate Republicans blocked the formation of a bipartisan independent commission to scrutinize the assault.
